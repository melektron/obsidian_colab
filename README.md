# Obsidian Collab

Open Source, live syncing and collaboration plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).



# Development

For plugin development, the plugin can be symlinked to an Obsidian Vault for testing:

```bash
ln -s /home/user/path/to/repos/obsidian_colab ~/Documents/path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian_colab
```

Also install [hot-reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) to automatically reload the plugin when making changes during development.
